        <h2>Game manual</h2>
        <span>
          The main game objective is to finish the plot. At the beginning of the
          game you’ll learn parts of the story but the rest is up to you. To
          move further you have to explore smaller parts of the main board by
          clicking on them and solving puzzles that you’ll discover. There may
          be many things you may find, but there is always a chance that you may
          find nothing. The puzzles you have already discovered may be accessed
          and solved at all times. Typing the solution in doesn’t use up your
          action points. Exploring every small part of the board will use up one
          of your „action points”, so choose wisely. Moving to another location
          is a reward and doesn’t cost action points. If you find yourself in a
          position when you don’t have any of said points, you can draw a
          „stress card” which will give you some of them in exchange for one of
          your evidence cards that you may find. There are many endings, and the
          number of evidence cards you collect will define which one is yours.

                You wander in the forest for a long time, you don't know where
                you are and it starts to get dark. Luckily, you managed to hide
                in an abandoned hut for the night. However, the house seems
                strange, something mysterious is hiding inside it. Can you find
                out the secret ...
                <br />
                <br />
                It is a game based on the escape room concept, but with no time
                limit to complete the game. The game focuses on the story of the
                plot, its exploration and solving puzzles. The decisions you
                make during the game will affect which puzzles will stand in
                your way, change the course of history and show one of several
                possible endings in the final.
