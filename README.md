## Working with the project

### Commit Message

We take the following format commit message

```
<type>: <commit_message>
```

#### Commit Message Type

- **build**:A change that affects project building or external dependencies
- **docs**: Change in documentation or additional materials
- **feature**:Introducing new functionality
- **bugfix**: Bug fix
- **refactor**: A design change that doesn't fix or add anything

#### Commit Message rules

- use the imperative present tense form: "change", not "changed" or "changes"
- do not start with a capital letter
- do not add a period at the end of the sentence
- use English
- format the code (shortcut ctrl + shift + F)

### Pull Request

We work on branches in the `branch per feature` methodology.
We try to create small PR. The description of the PR should be precisely described
what does he change. Each PR must be approved by at least one
another person.
